# AI CLI Preparation - direnv note
#
# The Makefile already includes variables from `.env.default` and `.env`,
# so you don't need direnv to export anything here.
#
# Suggested workflow:
# 1) Copy `.env.default` to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
# 2) Run `make update` to collect a snapshot, then `make audit` to render.
#
# If you prefer direnv to auto-load env files anyway, you may uncomment:
# use dotenv .env .env.default
