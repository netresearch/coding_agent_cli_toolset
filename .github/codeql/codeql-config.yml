# CodeQL Configuration
# Documentation of alert handling for this repository

name: "CLI Audit CodeQL Config"

# Note: Some alerts are documented as accepted risks:
#
# 1. py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization in cli_audit/catalog.py
#    - These are URL substring checks used for VERSION DETECTION only
#    - They determine which API to query for latest versions (npm, pypi, etc.)
#    - The package names come from the internal catalog, not user input
#    - No installation decisions are made based on these checks
#    - Security impact is LOW - worst case is incorrect version lookup
#
# 2. py/overly-permissive-file in tests/test_bulk.py
#    - This is TEST CODE operating on temporary directories
#    - Testing permission handling and error recovery
#    - Using 0o755 on temp dir is appropriate for test cleanup

# Query configuration
