# Product Requirements Document - AI CLI Preparation

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Specification

## Executive Summary

### Vision

Maximize AI coding agent performance by ensuring all necessary developer tools are installed, up-to-date, and correctly configured on development systems. Eliminate the "missing tool" friction that reduces agent effectiveness and interrupts development workflows.

### Problem Statement

AI coding agents (like Claude Code) require access to a comprehensive developer toolchain to function effectively. When tools are missing, outdated, or incorrectly installed, agent performance suffers through:

- **Failed Operations**: Agents cannot execute commands requiring missing tools
- **Degraded Quality**: Outdated tools lack features or have known bugs
- **Configuration Issues**: Tools installed via incorrect methods create PATH conflicts
- **Time Loss**: Manual tool management interrupts development flow

### Solution Overview

AI CLI Preparation is a specialized environment audit and installation management tool that:

1. **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Detects and reports on 50+ developer tools with version checking
2. **Phase 2 (Specified)**: Installs, updates, and upgrades tools with context-aware strategies
3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Automated maintenance and proactive monitoring

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Tool Coverage | 50+ essential tools | 50+ tools ✓ |
| Detection Accuracy | >95% version detection | ~92% |
| Installation Success Rate | >90% first-attempt | TBD (Phase 2) |
| Time to Readiness | <10 minutes for fresh system | TBD (Phase 2) |
| Agent Performance Gain | 30-50% fewer tool-related failures | TBD (validation) |

---

## Phase 1: Detection and Auditing (Complete)

### Capabilities Delivered

**Tool Discovery:**
- 50+ tools across 10 categories (runtimes, search, editors, formatters, security, etc.)
- Multi-source PATH scanning (system, user, project-local bins)
- Installation method classification (uv, pipx, npm, cargo, apt, rustup, nvm, etc.)

**Version Detection:**
- Parallel execution (16 workers, configurable)
- Multiple version flag detection (--version, -v, version, -V)
- Intelligent parsing for diverse output formats
- Resilient error handling with graceful degradation

**Upstream Resolution:**
- Multi-source API support (GitHub, PyPI, crates.io, npm, GNU FTP)
- HTTP layer with retries, exponential backoff, rate limiting
- Per-origin request caps (GitHub: 5/min, PyPI: 10/min, crates.io: 5/min)
- Offline-first design with committed cache (latest_versions.json)

**Output Formats:**
- Table view with status icons (✓ UP-TO-DATE, ↑ OUTDATED, ✗ NOT INSTALLED, ? UNKNOWN)
- JSON export for programmatic consumption
- Snapshot-based workflow (collect once, render many times)
- Role-based filtering (agent-core, python-core, security-core, etc.)

**Performance:**
- ~10s for 50 tools online (parallel execution)
- ~3s offline (cache hits)
- <100ms render-only mode (from snapshot)

### Architecture Highlights

**Threading Model:**
- ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable workers (default: 16)
- Lock ordering enforcement (MANUAL_LOCK → HINTS_LOCK for safety)
- Independent tool audits (failures isolated)

**Cache Hierarchy:**
- **Hints**: Optimization hints for faster lookups (__hints__ in latest_versions.json)
- **Manual**: User-committed versions (latest_versions.json)
- **Upstream**: Live API queries (fallback)

**Resilience Patterns:**
- Network failures → fallback to cache
- Version detection failures → graceful unknown status
- Upstream API errors → retry with exponential backoff
- Atomic file writes → prevent cache corruption

### Current Limitations (Phase 1)

- **No Installation**: Only detection and reporting
- **No Upgrades**: Cannot update outdated tools
- **Manual Intervention**: User must install/update tools manually
- **No Reconciliation**: Cannot resolve installation method conflicts
- **Limited Guidance**: Hints provided, but no automated execution

---

## Phase 2: Installation and Upgrade Management (Specification)

### Objectives

Enable automated installation, updating, and upgrading of tools with context-aware strategies that adapt to different environments (dev workstations, shared servers, CI/CD).

### Target Environments

**Primary: Development Workstations**
- Single-user systems (laptops, personal desktops)
- User-level installations preferred (~/.local/bin, ~/.cargo/bin)
- Flexibility and latest versions prioritized
- Breaking changes acceptable (developer handles)

**Secondary: Shared Development Servers**
- Multi-user systems (shared Linux servers, jump boxes)
- System-level installations preferred (/usr/local/bin)
- Coordination via advisory locks (prevent simultaneous installs)
- Stability prioritized over bleeding-edge versions

**Tertiary: CI/CD Environments**
- Ephemeral containers or VMs
- Fast installation critical (cache-based)
- Minimal installations (only required tools)
- Reproducibility via snapshot-based installs

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Context-Aware Installation

**Environment Detection:**
```python
def detect_environment():
    # CI indicators
    if any(env in os.environ for env in ['CI', 'GITHUB_ACTIONS', 'GITLAB_CI']):
        return 'ci'

    # Multi-user indicators
    user_count = len([u for u in get_active_users() if u.login_time])
    if user_count > 3:
        return 'server'

    # Default to workstation
    return 'workstation'
```

**Mode Behaviors:**

| Aspect | Workstation | Server | CI |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **Scope** | User (~/.local) | System (/usr/local) | Minimal (project) |
| **Prefer** | Vendor tools (rustup, nvm) | System packages (apt, brew) | Cache/snapshot |
| **Reconciliation** | Parallel (keep both) | Advisory (coordinate) | Replace (clean slate) |
| **Breaking Changes** | Accept (always latest) | Warn (manual approval) | Lock (exact versions) |

**Configuration Override:**
```yaml
# .cli-audit.yml
version: 1
environment:
  mode: auto  # auto | workstation | server | ci
  # mode: workstation  # Force workstation behavior
```

#### 2. Package Manager Hierarchy

**Preference Order** (Vendor → GitHub → System):

1. **Vendor-Specific Tools** (Highest Priority)
   - Python: uv → pipx → pip
   - Rust: rustup → cargo → system
   - Node.js: nvm → npm → system
   - Go: official installer → system
   - Rationale: Better version management, user isolation, parallel installs

2. **GitHub Releases** (Medium Priority)
   - Standalone binaries (fd, ripgrep, bat, delta, etc.)
   - Rationale: Latest versions, no system dependency conflicts

3. **System Package Managers** (Lowest Priority)
   - apt/dpkg, brew, pacman, etc.
   - Rationale: Slower updates, system-wide impact, potential conflicts

**Hierarchy Example:**
```
Install Python tools:
  1. Check for uv → Use if available
  2. Fallback to pipx → Install if not present
  3. Last resort: pip → Warn about global install risks
```

**Configuration Override:**
```yaml
tools:
  python:
    method: uv  # Force specific package manager
    fallback: pipx
```

#### 3. Parallel Installation Approach (Reconciliation)

**Philosophy**: Keep multiple installations, prefer user-level via PATH ordering

**Reconciliation Behavior:**
```
Scenario: ripgrep installed both via apt (system) and cargo (user)

Current State:
  ✓ ripgrep: 14.1.1 (cargo, ~/.cargo/bin) [ACTIVE]
  ℹ️  Also found: 14.0.0 (apt, /usr/bin)

Action: No removal
  - User version takes precedence (PATH ordering)
  - System version remains (may be needed for other users/scripts)
  - User can manually remove system version if desired

PATH Management:
  ~/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
  ↑ User bins first → takes precedence
```

**Aggressive Reconciliation** (Optional, disabled by default):
```yaml
preferences:
  reconciliation: aggressive  # Remove non-preferred installations
```

**Benefits:**
- No accidental removals
- Preserves system integrity
- User has full control
- Safe rollback (switch PATH ordering)

**Trade-offs:**
- Disk space (multiple versions)
- PATH complexity (potential confusion)
- Manual cleanup required

#### 4. Always-Latest Version Policy

**Philosophy**: Maximize tool performance by using latest versions; user handles breaking changes

**Version Selection:**
```
For each tool:
  1. Query upstream for latest version
  2. Compare with installed version
  3. If installed < latest:
     - Workstation: Auto-upgrade (with warning)
     - Server: Prompt for approval
     - CI: Use locked version from snapshot
```

**Breaking Change Handling:**

**Major Version Upgrade Detection:**
```python
def is_major_upgrade(current: str, latest: str) -> bool:
    curr_major = int(current.split('.')[0])
    latest_major = int(latest.split('.')[0])
    return latest_major > curr_major
```

**Warning System:**
```
⚠️  Major version upgrade detected:
    Tool: ripgrep
    Current: 13.0.0
    Latest: 14.1.1

    Potential breaking changes:
    - Regex syntax changes
    - Flag deprecations
    - Output format changes

    Proceed? [y/N]
```

**Configuration:**
```yaml
preferences:
  breaking_changes: accept  # accept | warn | reject
  auto_upgrade: true        # Auto-upgrade minor/patch versions
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
```bash
# Before upgrade, create restore point
cli_audit upgrade --create-snapshot

# After upgrade, if issues:
cli_audit rollback --from-snapshot
```

#### 5. Installation Execution

**Single Tool Install:**
```bash
# Auto-detect best method
cli_audit install ripgrep

# Force specific method
cli_audit install ripgrep --method cargo

# Install specific version
cli_audit install ripgrep@14.0.0
```

**Bulk Install:**
```bash
# Install all missing tools
cli_audit install --missing

# Install all outdated tools
cli_audit upgrade --all

# Install from role preset
cli_audit install --preset agent-core
```

**Script Generation:**
```bash
# Generate install script (review before execution)
cli_audit install --missing --dry-run > install.sh
bash install.sh
```

**Installation Workflow:**
```
1. Pre-check: Verify permissions, disk space, network connectivity
2. Dependency resolution: Check for required runtimes (e.g., Python for uv)
3. Download: Fetch installers/binaries with retry logic
4. Verification: Checksum validation (if available)
5. Installation: Execute package manager or extract binary
6. Post-install: Verify version, update PATH (if needed)
7. Snapshot update: Record new installation state
```

#### 6. Configuration File Format

**File Location:**
```
.cli-audit.yml (project root)
~/.config/cli-audit/config.yml (user global)
/etc/cli-audit/config.yml (system global)
```

**Precedence**: Project → User → System

**Schema:**
```yaml
version: 1  # Schema version

environment:
  mode: auto  # auto | workstation | server | ci

tools:
  # Per-tool configuration
  python:
    version: "3.12.*"  # SemVer range
    method: uv         # Preferred package manager
    fallback: pipx

  ripgrep:
    version: "latest"  # Always latest
    method: cargo

  node:
    version: "20.*"    # Major version lock
    method: nvm

preferences:
  reconciliation: parallel     # parallel | aggressive
  breaking_changes: warn       # accept | warn | reject
  auto_upgrade: true           # Auto-upgrade minor/patch
  timeout_seconds: 5           # Network timeout
  max_workers: 16              # Parallel workers

  # Package manager hierarchy override
  package_managers:
    python: [uv, pipx, pip]
    rust: [rustup, cargo]
    node: [nvm, npm]

presets:
  # Custom role presets
  my-python-stack:
    - python
    - uv
    - black
    - ruff
    - pyright
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Validate configuration file
cli_audit config validate

# Show effective configuration (after merging)
cli_audit config show
```

```

**Reconciliation Output:**
```
Reconciling ripgrep installations:

Found 2 installations:
  [1] 14.1.1 (cargo, ~/.cargo/bin) [PREFERRED]
  [2] 14.0.0 (apt, /usr/bin)

Strategy: parallel (keep both)

Actions:
  ✓ PATH ordering ensures [1] is active
  ℹ️  [2] remains available for other users
  💡 Run 'cli_audit reconcile --aggressive' to remove [2]

Current PATH:
  ~/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
  ↑ ripgrep 14.1.1 will be used
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Correctly identifies all tool installations
- PATH ordering ensures preferred version is active
- Aggressive mode safely removes non-preferred versions
- Conflict resolution prevents broken installations

### Technical Requirements

**System Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+ (for core runtime)
- Network access (for upstream queries, can work offline with cache)
- Write permissions (user: ~/.local, system: /usr/local or /opt)
- 100MB disk space (for cache and snapshots)

**Dependencies:**
- Standard library only (no external Python packages for core)
- Optional: requests (for improved HTTP handling vs urllib)

**Performance Targets:**
- Single tool install: <30s (excluding download time)
- Bulk install (10 tools): <5 minutes
- Upgrade check: <10s (parallel upstream queries)
- Environment detection: <100ms

**Error Handling:**
- Network failures: retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Permission errors: clear error message with sudo guidance
- Disk space: pre-check before installation
- Dependency failures: install dependencies automatically or guide user

**Security:**
- Checksum verification for GitHub releases (SHA256)
- HTTPS-only for upstream queries
- No arbitrary code execution (package manager commands only)
- User confirmation for system-level installations

- **Impact**: High (workflow disruption)
- **Probability**: Medium (depends on tool ecosystem)

**2. Installation Failures**
- **Risk**: Network errors, permission issues, corrupted downloads
- **Mitigation**: Retry logic, checksum verification, clear error messages
- **Impact**: Medium (requires manual intervention)
- **Probability**: Medium (network/permission variability)

**3. PATH Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Multiple installations create confusion, wrong version used
- **Mitigation**: Parallel reconciliation, PATH management, clear reporting
- **Impact**: Medium (wrong tool version used)
- **Probability**: High (common in real environments)

### Medium-Risk Areas

**4. Dependency Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Tool A requires Python 3.11, Tool B requires Python 3.12
- **Mitigation**: Version range detection, conflict warnings, user resolution
- **Impact**: Medium (manual resolution required)
- **Probability**: Low (rare in practice)

**5. Disk Space Exhaustion**
- **Risk**: Multiple installations consume excessive disk space
- **Mitigation**: Pre-check disk space, aggressive reconciliation option
- **Impact**: Low (easy to resolve)
